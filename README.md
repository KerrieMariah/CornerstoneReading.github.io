# Cornerstone Reading

I'm going to be reading the foundational books of Western Literature and rating them as I go along. This is to keep track of my progress throughout the months as my pet project.

Here is what ChatGPT had to say about it:
`Embark on an extraordinary literary odyssey as I delve into the foundational books of Western civilization. Join me on this captivating journey where I immerse myself in the timeless wisdom of these works, uncovering their profound insights and thought-provoking narratives. As I turn each page, I'll not only rate these literary masterpieces but also share my unique viewpoints, sparking engaging discussions and inviting you, my audience, to join me in exploring the intellectual treasures that have shaped our cultural heritage. Get ready to embark on an adventure of enlightenment, where ancient wisdom meets contemporary analysis, as we unravel the tapestry of Western civilization's most influential writings together.`

It clearly has a bit more optimism about the seriousness of my pursuit, I will mostly be making memes
